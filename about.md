Hello World! 

I'm JayChen, a developer filled with romanticism but also pragmatism. I believe that the world can be described by Math and Physics, however I prefer to explain some problems from the perspective of Philosophy.

I work on a cloud-based software company, and prefer to work with Golang, Python or C++.

### More Information

I was also interested in the Computer Version, and build a model [GLGAN](https://github.com/infinityjay/GLGAN_20201016) based on the GAN during the master's degree.
